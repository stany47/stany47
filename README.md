### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Heard about GitHub years ago; Never really been in the programming business and still not. 
Starting small sketch programs with Processing and  lately with p5.js and trying to find out if GitHub can help me somehow keeping some order
in the increasing amount of sketches all over the place in my computer. 
No real project yet and simply discovering how GitHub works
